# TicTacToe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game with an AI that can't be beat.

This is one of the games I made before I started attending Tennessee Tech. I would have made it during the summer of 2015. I know the code design is horrible, everything I knew about programming I had taught myself in the previous 6 months.

That being said, this project does display the use of an event loop and minimax with alpha/beta pruning, among other things.

To run:

If you have ant, then you can just run it with no parameters from the project root directory. Otherwise just run the .jar file
